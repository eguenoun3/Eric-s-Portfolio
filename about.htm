            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <img src="IMG_4465.jpg" width="200">
            <p>Hi, I’m Eric Guenoun, a computational media major at Georgia Tech with a deep passion for the technical side of video game development. I enjoy creating immersive and interactive digital experiences that merge code and creativity.</p>

               <p> My expertise lies in game development technologies, including proficiency in programming languages like C# and Python, and tools like Unity and Unreal Engine. I’ve worked on creating dynamic and interactive systems, handling everything from gameplay mechanics to integrating complex algorithms.</p>
                
                <p>One of my most significant projects, Empathy Bytes VIP, allowed me to explore the use of interactive digital systems to promote empathy through gameplay. Additionally, I’ve built several smaller games, implementing mechanics like physics-based interactions, AI-driven characters, and multiplayer experiences. These projects have helped me hone my skills in optimizing game performance and designing engaging user interactions.</p>
                
                <p>I’m particularly excited about the potential of video games as a medium for both entertainment and education. From the challenge of coding physics simulations to the reward of creating seamless user experiences, I enjoy the problem-solving and creativity that game development requires.</p>
                
                <p>My goal is to work in the video game industry as a technical developer, focusing on creating efficient and immersive gaming systems. I’m looking for opportunities to contribute to game development teams where I can bring my coding and design skills to life in creating captivating digital worlds.</p>
                
                <p>When I’m not coding or developing games, you can find me playing strategy or RPG games, which inspire many of the mechanics and systems I experiment with in my own projects.</p>

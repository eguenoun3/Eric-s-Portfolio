                    <h3>ATLFoodFinder</h3>
                    <p>The Atlanta Food Finder is an interactive web application designed to help users discover local restaurants in the Atlanta area. By leveraging the Google Maps API, the platform allows users to easily search for restaurants based on location, filter results by cuisine, and access essential details like hours of operation and reviews. The focus of the project was to create a user-friendly experience that makes exploring dining options intuitive and enjoyable.</p>

                        <p><strong>My Role as the Backend Developer:</strong></p>
                        
                        As the backend developer, I was responsible for building and maintaining the server-side logic of the Atlanta Food Finder. I developed the backend using Django in Python, integrating the Google Maps API to dynamically fetch and display restaurant data based on user searches. Additionally, I implemented real-time updates using AJAX to provide a seamless experience without needing to refresh the page, ultimately improving the overall responsiveness and user engagement of the platform. My work focused on optimizing data flow, ensuring efficient API integration, and enhancing the usability of the search and filter features..</p>

                    <img src="empathyBytesSS.png" width="600">
                    <p>Empathy Bytes is a Vertically Integrated Project (VIP) at Georgia Tech focused on creating immersive digital experiences that foster empathy through virtual reality. The project involves developing a VR archive of Georgia Tech's history, allowing users to interact with and explore significant historical moments and artifacts. The aim is to leverage emerging technologies like VR to enhance emotional engagement, promote empathy, and create a meaningful connection between users and the history of the institution.</p>

                        <p><strong>My Role as Part of the Unity Team:</strong></p>
                        
                        As a member of the Unity team, I played a key role in developing the interactive VR environment using Unity 3D and C#. My responsibilities included importing, optimizing, and polishing 3D assets to enhance the realism and immersion of the experience. I also integrated the Oculus SDK to ensure compatibility and an optimal user experience for VR headsets. Additionally, I managed version control and collaboration with Git, ensuring that the teamâ€™s contributions were synchronized effectively, and that the development process ran smoothly. My focus was on creating a visually engaging and interactive virtual world that allowed users to connect with the content in an impactful way.</p>
        
                    <h3>A-Frame Virtual Reality Experience</h3>

                    <img src="notflatSS.png" width="400">
                    <p>This project involved using A-Frame, a web framework for building virtual reality experiences, to create a 3D interactive recreation of a 2D artwork. The goal was to bring a traditional 2D piece of art into a new dimension, allowing users to explore the artwork from different perspectives and experience its elements in a more immersive way. By adding depth, spatial arrangement, and interactive components, the project transformed the flat artwork into a rich 3D environment that could be experienced directly in the browser.</p>

                       <p> <strong>My Role in the Project: </strong></p>
                        
                        <p>As the developer, I designed and built the 3D environment using A-Frame, focusing on recreating the visual essence and artistic details of the original 2D piece. I used WebVR technologies to ensure compatibility with VR devices, allowing users to explore the recreated artwork interactively. My responsibilities included modeling and positioning 3D elements to match the composition of the original artwork, adding interactive components to allow users to engage with the scene, and optimizing performance for seamless viewing on both desktop and VR platforms. The project aimed to bridge the gap between traditional art and digital interactivity, giving viewers a new way to experience art beyond the canvas.</p>
